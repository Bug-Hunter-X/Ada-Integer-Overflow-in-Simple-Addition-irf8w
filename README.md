This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: integer overflow. The `bug.ada` file contains a function `Add_One` that adds 1 to an integer.  However, if the input is sufficiently large, the addition might result in an overflow, leading to undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to mitigate this by using appropriate exception handling or alternative data types.
